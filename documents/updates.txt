THIS MONTH IN FINANCE AND BANKING NZ (DETAILED VERSION)

DATE: 09/09/2025
SUMMARY: The New Zealand financial technology and banking sector entered a new phase of strategic evolution and regulatory maturation. Developments over the past 30 days were defined by a significant leap forward in open banking, a material shift in market conduct expectations, and a targeted monetary policy intervention. The interplay between these factors reveals an ecosystem moving from nascent innovation to a more structured, and in some areas, more restrictive, regulatory environment.

1. COMPANY UPDATES


1.1. Strategic Partnerships Drive Open Banking Transition

The most significant development in the company space was the announcement of a key partnership that will materially advance New Zealand's open banking capabilities. POLi Pay has secured partnerships with all four of New Zealand's largest banks, solidifying its role within the nation's emerging open banking landscape.1 This collaboration is particularly noteworthy as it signals a crucial transition for POLi Pay from its historical use of less secure screen-scraping methods to secure, bank-approved open banking APIs. The move is presented as a strong example of how established banks and fintechs can work together to drive innovation and set new standards for payments.1
A press release from Westpac specifically detailed its strategic agreement with POLi Pay, noting that the partnership will bring "secure open banking payments to life for thousands of New Zealand consumers and businesses".2 This relationship provides instant scale and transaction volume to Westpac's open banking ecosystem, with the bank committing to waiving API fees for at least 12 months to support the fintech’s transition.2 The collaboration provides a path for Westpac customers to authenticate and authorize payments directly within the bank’s secure digital environment, ensuring customer credentials are never shared.2
This series of events, while appearing to be straightforward win-win collaborations, also highlights a more complex dynamic. The contemporaneous Commerce Commission report on open banking, released in early September, reveals a potential tension. The Commission expresses concern that the current path "will not materially enhance competition because the major banks will remain in control".4 The Commission's report specifically criticizes BNZ for its reluctance to partner with entities that use less secure access methods for use cases not yet supported by the new API infrastructure. This contrasts with the approach of other major banks, who are actively partnering to facilitate a smoother transition.4 The situation suggests that while some banks are collaborating with key fintech players, this collaboration may also be a form of strategic competition, aimed at securing dominance over the new payment rails and consolidating market power, rather than genuinely democratizing access for all participants.

1.2. Investment Platforms Expand into Digital Assets

Sharesies, one of New Zealand's prominent investment platforms, is set to expand its offerings by introducing cryptocurrency trading. The company has announced that the feature is "coming soon" to its platform, which currently provides access to New Zealand, US, and Australian markets for stocks, ETFs, and managed funds.5 The initiative is a direct response to customer demand and aims to simplify crypto investment for New Zealanders by removing common obstacles related to wallets and personal keys. The service will initially focus on major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.6 This move positions Sharesies to compete in a rapidly evolving market, expanding its services to a high-demand asset class and increasing its competitiveness within the fintech sector.6
This local product development strategy must be viewed in the context of broader global trends. A review of global fintech venture capital from the second quarter of 2025 reveals a significant change in investor preferences.7 While global funding volumes rebounded strongly, a key characteristic of the quarter was the concentration of capital around fewer, larger deals. Venture capital firms are increasingly prioritizing "scalable infrastructure and defensible business models," particularly in payments and insurance technology, and are moving away from risk-heavy consumer-facing categories like digital lending and neobanks.7 This creates a notable divergence between the consumer-driven product strategy of a local company like Sharesies and the cautious investment posture of global institutional capital. While Sharesies is responding to its retail user base, the company's expansion into a category global investors are increasingly wary of could present a future challenge in securing large-scale international funding unless it can articulate how its crypto offering fits within a more robust and scalable financial infrastructure model.

2. MARKET UPDATES


2.1. RBNZ Lowers OCR to Stimulate the Economy

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) made a significant monetary policy decision in August, voting to lower the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.0 percent.8 The rationale provided by the Monetary Policy Committee was multifaceted. The Committee identified significant spare productive capacity in the economy and noted that domestic inflationary pressures are declining, with headline inflation expected to return to the 2 percent target mid-point by mid-2026.8 The policy is intended to support economic activity and employment, with the RBNZ observing that the recovery has been uneven across different sectors and regions.9 While higher commodity prices are benefiting the agricultural sector, industries that sell primarily to New Zealanders, such as retail and construction, have continued to struggle, and unemployment has been on the rise.9
The OCR reduction is expected to have a direct impact on the financial sector. The RBNZ noted that wholesale interest rates have already fallen, which is leading to lower mortgage and term deposit rates.8 The transmission of these lower rates is anticipated to reduce debt servicing costs for households as a large portion of existing mortgages are expected to re-fix onto lower rates over the next six months.8 This creates a clear tailwind for fintech lending platforms, as their products become more competitive and attractive to borrowers. Conversely, the same reduction in interest rates makes savings-oriented products, such as Sharesies' PIE Save, less appealing to investors seeking a competitive return on their cash holdings. The RBNZ’s policy thus creates a strategic push-pull dynamic, stimulating the lending side of the fintech ecosystem while simultaneously making the savings side less attractive, which presents a strategic challenge for platforms that rely on both business models.

2.2. Consolidation of Global Venture Capital

A key report on global fintech funding in Q2 2025 provides a crucial external context for New Zealand's market. The analysis reveals a material rebound in overall funding, with volumes reaching $11 billion across nearly 400 transactions. However, this recovery was characterized by a concentration of capital around fewer, larger deals, with "mega-rounds" (exceeding $100 million) more than doubling compared to the previous quarter.7 This trend is not a return to previous market conditions but a fundamental shift in strategy by venture capital firms. Instead of deploying capital broadly across many deals, investors are now prioritizing "scalable infrastructure and defensible business models".7 The report highlights that payments and insurance technology were the primary beneficiaries of this strategic shift, with investors focusing on these sectors as core enablers of enterprise finance and consumer access, rather than optional add-ons.7
This global trend presents a potential investment disconnect for the New Zealand market. While the local ecosystem has seen significant innovation in consumer-facing platforms and products, the global capital that could fuel the next phase of growth for these companies is increasingly looking for a different kind of opportunity. Local firms seeking international investment may need to re-evaluate their value proposition, emphasizing how their solutions address underlying infrastructure problems rather than just consumer-facing applications to attract this targeted and concentrated pool of capital.

3. LEGAL AND REGULATORY CHANGES


3.1. Open Banking Framework Reaches Critical Milestone

The Commerce Commission’s release of its September 2025 update on open banking progress underscored a significant milestone in New Zealand's regulatory journey. The report reaffirms that the Customer and Product Data Act 2025 (CPD Act), which passed earlier this year, will begin regulating the domestic open banking ecosystem from 1 December 2025.4 This legislative framework designates banking as the first sector to be regulated, requiring the four major banks to join the Consumer Data Right (CDR) regime. Kiwibank will follow with a phased implementation from 1 June 2026.4 The report notes that the major banks and Kiwibank together serve approximately 90% of all New Zealand bank accounts, making their participation a critical step.4
While the regulatory milestones are progressing, the Commerce Commission's commentary reveals a significant concern regarding the implementation. The Commission states that it wants to see progress "accelerate" and for domestic open banking payment providers to "compete with the international scheme networks".4 This concern is rooted in observations of bank conduct. The report highlights that while most major banks have shown improved conduct since Commissioners met with CEOs in April, BNZ has not partnered with entities that would continue to use less secure "suboptimal" access methods for unsupported use cases, a position that is deemed to hinder the transition.4 The Commission's position is that if banks remain in control and do not facilitate an open ecosystem, the very purpose of the legislation—to foster competition—will be undermined, leading to the consolidation of power rather than its distribution.

3.2. FMA Expands Scope of Insider Trading

In August 2025, the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) published a new report that represents a material shift in its market conduct expectations. The report, titled Shadow insider trading: Regulatory expectations and emerging conduct risk, introduces the concept of "shadow insider trading".11 This is defined as the use of non-public, material information (NPMI) about one listed issuer to trade in the financial products of another "economically related" listed issuer.11 The FMA’s view is that this conduct is already prohibited under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMC Act), which significantly expands the interpretation of existing law and has market-wide implications.11
The FMA’s report gives two examples of how this concept could lead to insider trading liability: in capital raises within a concentrated sector, and in mergers and acquisitions where the value of a peer firm could be impacted by a deal.11 For market participants, particularly fund managers and other capital markets intermediaries, this expanded view creates a significant compliance burden. Firms must now "carefully assess" all potential implications of their trading activity across related products.11 The report's failure to precisely define "economically related" introduces a considerable degree of legal uncertainty, making it difficult for firms to confidently navigate their compliance obligations. This regulatory ambiguity could have a "chilling effect" on New Zealand's capital markets, potentially slowing down legitimate capital raises and M&A deals as firms and individuals become overly cautious to mitigate the risk of inadvertent liability. This new regulatory interpretation is a key headwind for a sector already navigating a fragile macroeconomic environment.

4. Synthesis and Strategic Outlook

The analysis of the last 30 days reveals a New Zealand financial sector in a state of deliberate, policy-driven transformation. The strategic moves of companies and the macro-level economic conditions are directly influenced by a tightening and evolving regulatory environment. The RBNZ's OCR cut sets a macroeconomic stage of cautious optimism, designed to stimulate a fragile economy.8 However, the policy's effects are two-sided, with tailwinds for lending platforms and headwinds for savings-oriented products.
Against this backdrop, two major regulatory shifts are actively shaping the future of finance. The open banking framework is solidifying, but the Commerce Commission's report reveals that the path to true competition is not guaranteed and requires constant monitoring of bank-fintech dynamics.4 Simultaneously, the FMA's new stance on "shadow insider trading" raises the bar for market conduct, creating new compliance risks and potentially slowing down deal-making.11
The POLi Pay-Westpac partnership is a microcosm of these forces: a collaboration that solves a technical problem but is also a strategic play for market control in a new regulatory environment.1 Likewise, Sharesies' crypto launch is a response to consumer demand that may not align with the direction of global institutional capital.5
Looking ahead, the next quarter will be crucial. All eyes will be on the major banks as they operationalise their open banking obligations ahead of the 1 December deadline. Market participants will be working to update internal policies in light of the FMA's new guidance. The strategic decisions made by fintechs in the coming months, in light of both macroeconomic stimulus and heightened regulatory scrutiny, will determine who thrives in New Zealand's increasingly complex financial ecosystem.
